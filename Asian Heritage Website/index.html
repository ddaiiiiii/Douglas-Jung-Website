	<h4>History</h4>

		<p>Douglas Jung was born on the date February 25th, 1924 in Victoria B.C on Douglas Street, which is how he got his name. He grew up in an average household alongside with his other two brother. He later attended Victoria Highschool but faced many cases of racial discrimination both in school and in life.. But even so, he faced the challenges and enlisted in the Canadian army during World War two to serve for his country, alongside with thirteen other Chinese Canadians all participating in ‘‘Operation Oblivion.’’ The operation trained Chinese background soldiers for combat and spy work, they were later deployed into china where it was occupied by the Japanese. The group force was named ‘‘Chinese Canadian of force 136.’’ Unfortunately, Douglas had injured himself during a parachute exercise in Australia which meant he had to stay behind and worked as an intelligence instructor. However, the brave and patriotic act by Douglas and the Chinese Canadian of force 136 won over the hearts of the people, which eventually lead to the withdrawal of Chinese Canadian voting restrictions by the government. Finally bringing equality to the people, a great important achievement made by Douglas and the Chinese Canadian troops. After the ending of the war, Douglas went back to British Columbia and attended university of British Columbia to finish his education using his veteran benefits. He received two degrees, one being Bachelor of Arts and the other being Bachelor of Law, which lead to his career as a lawyer. A year after graduation he made history in becoming the first ever Chinese Canadian to appear before British Columbia’s court of appeal.</p>
